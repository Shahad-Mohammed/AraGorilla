## Overview

Welcome to AraGorilla, an Arabic Large Language Model (LLM) tailored for handling Arabic prompts and generating precise API responses. This repository contains everything you need to know about AraGorilla, from its features to its implementation details.

## Features

- **Fine-tuned Arabic LLM:** AraGorilla is specifically trained to understand Arabic requests and provide accurate API responses.
- **Structured Pipeline:** Our structured pipeline ensures efficiency and reduces hallucinations in API responses.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** We employ the RAG approach to further enhance response accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** We use AST sub-tree matching and cosine similarity to evaluate AraGorilla's performance.

## Usage

To get started with AraGorilla, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the necessary dependencies for fine-tuning and evaluation.
3. **Fine-Tune the Model:** Use the provided dataset to fine-tune AraGorilla according to your needs.
4. **Evaluate Performance:** Evaluate AraGorilla's performance using the provided metrics.

## Methodology

AraGorilla's development process involves several key stages:

1. **Dataset Processing:** We preprocess the dataset to prepare it for fine-tuning.
2. **Instruction Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tune the model to understand Arabic requests accurately.
3. **Retrieval-Aware Inference:** Implement retrieval-aware inference to improve response quality.
4. **Model Development:** Develop AraGorilla based on the structured pipeline and RAG approach.

## Evaluation

We assess AraGorilla's performance through rigorous evaluation using AST sub-tree matching and cosine similarity metrics. Comparative analysis with other Arabic LLMs demonstrates its superiority in generating API calls from Arabic prompts.
