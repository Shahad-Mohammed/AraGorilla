## Introduction

AraGorilla is an Arabic Large Language Model (LLM) specifically designed to handle Arabic prompts and generate precise API responses. In this repository, we provide the implementation and fine-tuning details of AraGorilla.

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) for Arabic have seen significant advancements, yet their ability to interact with APIs remains limited. AraGorilla addresses this limitation by introducing an Arabic LLM fine-tuned for understanding Arabic requests and generating accurate API responses. Using a structured pipeline inspired by the self-instruct paradigm, AraGorilla aims to enhance efficiency and reduce hallucinations in API responses.

## Features

- Fine-tuned Arabic Large Language Model (LLM)
- Structured pipeline for generating Arabic instructions for APIs
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for reducing hallucinations
- Evaluation metrics include AST sub-tree matching and cosine similarity

## Methodology

The methodology involves dataset processing, instruction fine-tuning, retrieval-aware inference, and the development of AraGorilla. We provide detailed steps and configurations used in each stage of the process.

## Evaluation

AraGorilla's performance is evaluated using AST sub-tree matching and cosine similarity metrics. Comparative analysis with other Arabic LLMs demonstrates its superiority in generating API calls from Arabic prompts.

## Usage

To use AraGorilla, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Fine-tune the model using the provided dataset.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using the provided metrics.
